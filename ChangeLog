    * Release: Version 0.1.3

    - Changed the shebang line so that gpx2svg now also runs on Mac

    - Changed the use of the literal "/dev/stdin" and "/dev/stdout" to sys.stdin and sys.stdout.
      Hopefully, gpx2svg will now also work on Windows (not tested).

    - Overall code cleanup

    * Release: Version 0.1.2

    - Fixed crash when processing GPX files with empty or no path segments.
      Thanks to Fabian Seitz for the bug report!

      data.

    * Relase: Version 0.1.1

    - Made the internal data structure simpler. Don't store the IDs of the tracks.

    - Combine path segments before doing the Mercator projection, so that rounding errors can't
      affect the search.

    - Made the algorithm to search for combinable paths more effective.

    - Draw circles instead of single points (that will not be shown). Added an command line option
      to drop such single points.
